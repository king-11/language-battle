# Programming Language Battleground

There is always a battle between which language is the best, why is a particular language better than other, why the particular thing was made a way it is. All this knowledge is spread out in the winds of network packets. We are trying to build a single source of truth from anyone to make decision on which Programming Language to choose as per their requirements.

A bunch of us at Software Development Guild [SDG](https://sdg.copsiitbhu.co.in), [COPS](https://github.com/cops-iitbhu) decided to take up on this task of highlightning the advantages and disadvantages of every language that we can cover as per our bandwidth. Since, it's open source we welcome all kinds of contribution.
